# Temperature-Conventer-
The purpose of this project is to implement a temperature converter using MIPS Assembly language. The user selects an input temperature unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, or Rankine), provides a value, and the program converts it to the remaining three units and displays them.
